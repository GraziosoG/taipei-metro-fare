- In this repo, you will find the code to evaluate if the monthly metro ticket is an economical option for you to purchase. 
- Ticket prices were collect [here](https://data.taipei/dataset/detail?id=4acb4911-0360-4063-808d-fcee629508b3) from the open data platform.
- I then created an API to get the ticket prices from above source.  
     - The previous version of this app stored only the adult full fare ticket prices and retrieve without an API call. View repo [here](https://github.com/GraziosoG/taipei-metro).
