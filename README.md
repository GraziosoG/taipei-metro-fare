- In this repo, you will find the code to evaluate if the monthly metro ticket is an economical option for you to purchase. 
- Ticket prices were collected from the [open data platform](https://data.taipei/dataset/detail?id=4acb4911-0360-4063-808d-fcee629508b3).
- I then created an API to get the ticket prices from above source.     
- This app supports all kinds of tickets.
     - Adult Full Fare Tickets
     - Senior, Charity, Companion and New Taipei City Children
     - Taipei City Children
- This app is currently available in Mandarin. 
- Try the app [here](https://graziosog.github.io/mrt/mrt.html).


- The previous version of this app stores only the adult full fare ticket prices and retrieves them without an API call. View repo [#taipei-metro](https://github.com/GraziosoG/taipei-metro).
